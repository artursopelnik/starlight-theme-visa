> **Work in Progress**

This project is a custom **Starlight** theme inspired by the design of Visa's documentation.  

It's still under active development — feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Notes
- The theme is designed to be **responsive**, **mobile-friendly** and **accessible (dark-theme-support)**.

- The font used is **IBM Plex Sans**, an open-source alternative to Visa's proprietary **Dialect UI** font.
- If you don't like the default **Starmind Astro** icons and are looking for an open-source alternative to Visa's icons, check out **[Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)**.
